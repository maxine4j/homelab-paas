For every runtime behavior follow strict Red → Green → Refactor: write a focused behavioral test, run it and observe the expected failure (fix setup errors first), implement the smallest passing change, run focused tests, then refactor while green. Never skip the observed RED step. Test observable behavior and architectural seams, not implementation details. No artificial tests for documentation or types. Preserve unrelated work. Run all required repository checks (tests, formatting, lint, typecheck, build), review the final diff, stage only task-owned changes, and create one local commit for the implementation. For review followups, add a separate local commit after validation. Never amend another agent's commits. If blocked or validation fails, report the blocker and leave unfinished work uncommitted. Finish with a concise result and validation evidence; do not claim success prematurely.\n\n${scope}\n\nApproved plan:\n${job.plan?.text ?? ""}\n\n${job.phase === "review" ?
